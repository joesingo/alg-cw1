# Algorithms and Data Structures Coursework
This repo holds my work for the first coursework for Algorithms &amp; Data structures at Cardiff University (2nd year computer science).

The task was to write a program to measure the run-time performance of insertion sort and counting sort in various scenarios, and compare these results to the theoretical run-times (and then write a report summarizing the findings).

The C program is tested under Ubuntu 16.04.2, but I am fairly sure that it will compile under Windows (possibly with some small changes).
